Hi, everybody! It's a new book. It's Clare who is editing this, obviously. Most importantly, today, is Programmer's Day, again. Remember the ***1024*** last year, i'm uploading some little demo of code which can be carried up in github.    
Not knowing why, i'm totally not in the state of work after *16:00*. I'm not sure whether it was because of the terrible weather or the terrible weather. Oh. What i'm saying is just nonsense. I'm more convinced of the opinion in ***predictably irrational*** that people can not predict one's strategy at their different emotional state. And, one can not make everything to run as he planned beforehand.    
Back to the book, right, first i'll push the catelog... of the first part that i've read of course. The whole catelog is juuust a huge. Ha~
